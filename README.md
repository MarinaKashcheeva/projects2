| [02 - Choosing regions for the next promo campaign of a drink company in Russia](https://github.com/MarinaKashcheeva/projects2/blob/main/02_Choosing%20regions%20for%20the%20next%20promo%20campaign%20of%20a%20drink%20company%20in%20Russia.ipynb) | The company owns a chain of stores across Russia that sell a variety of alcoholic drinks. The company recently ran a wine promotion in Saint Petersburg that was very successful. The marketing team would like to target 10 other regions that have similar buying habits to Saint Petersburg where they would expect the promotion to be similarly successful. | EN | *scipy, sklearn, matplotlib* |
| [03 - Reducing employee turnover](https://github.com/MarinaKashcheeva/projects2/blob/main/03_Reducing%20employee%20turnover.ipynb) | You work for the human capital department of a large corporation. The Board is worried about the relatively high turnover, and your team must look into ways to reduce the number of employees leaving the company. The team needs to understand better the situation, which employees are more likely to leave, and why. Once it is clear what variables impact employee churn, you can present your findings along with your ideas on how to attack the problem. | EN | *sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn* |
| [04 - Segmentation of the customer base](https://github.com/MarinaKashcheeva/projects2/blob/main/04_Segmentation%20of%20the%20customer%20base%20of%20a%20large%20manufacturer%20of%20sweets.ipynb) | The task is to analyze the purchase history of customers of a branded store of a large manufacturer of sweets. We will segment the customers based on RFM analysis to identify the most promising segments and segments that need to be reactivated. We'll also analyze the frequency of purchases in the branded store. The results of the analysis and the segmentation will be used in order to develop a communication strategy for the company. | EN | *pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn* |
| [05 - Analyzing A/B test results](https://github.com/MarinaKashcheeva/projects2/blob/main/05_Analyzing%20AB%20test%20results.ipynb) | Our team has been working on a redesign of the landing page. The team believes a new design will increase the number of people who click through and join the site. They have been testing the changes for a few weeks and now they want to measure the impact of the change. We need to determine if the increase can be due to random chance or if it is statistically significant. | EN | *scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib* |
